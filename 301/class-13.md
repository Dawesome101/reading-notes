1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
   - REST is an architectural system centered around resources and Hypermedia using HTTP commands. CRUD is a cycle meant to maintain records in a database setting. In its base form, CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands.
