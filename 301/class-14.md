## [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
   - The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
   - They built a techie culture and were assumed to have been playing with computers they were growing up. In the '70s, that never would have happened: Professors in intro classes assumed their students came in with no experience. But by the '80s, that had changed.
