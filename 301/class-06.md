## [An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

1. What is node.js?
   - Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
   - Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
   - It's open source JS magic that makes JS work directly on any computer.
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
   - It's a program we can use to execute JavaScript over time... run javascript on "time".... run-time.
4. What is npm?
   - A package manager for javascript.
5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
   - `v18.4.0`
6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
   - `v18.12.1`
7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
   - npm install -g jshint
8. What is node used for?
   - installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.  
   These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
   1. Greater Efficiency
   2. Engaged Collaboration
   3. Learning from Fellow Students
   4. Social Skills
   5. Job Interview Readiness
   6. Work Environment Readiness
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
   - Learning from fellow students. On more than one occasion I've had a fellow collaborator tell me about a VSCode shortcut or function I didn't know about or decide to program something a completely different way than I would have gone about it. I wouldn't have had the experience if not for paired programming.  At first it sat a little weird with me but I found quickly that it was actually really helpful and benificial for both parties. Though I dont think pair programming is always the best approach as sometimes you need to go it alone a little bit, but there are definitely times when it is really helpful and educational.  It's an indispensable tool.
3. How does pair programming work?
   - While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
