## [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html)

Treating each other as if you would a friend when you were a child is close to what google learned about what makes the best kinds of groups.  I think it all comes down to true empathy for a person. Understanding that just as you have imperfections so do they and giving each other grace is the quickest way to build a bond.  Bonded folk who treat each other with respect while also keeping an honest eye on your own truths makes for effective relationships and effective teams.
