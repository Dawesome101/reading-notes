## Website Design
- What is your website about? Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?
- What information are you presenting on the subject? Write a title and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
- What does your website look like, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?

## What is JavaScript
- JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich \(co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation\).
- JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
