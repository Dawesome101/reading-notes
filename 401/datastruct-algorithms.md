## Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
   1. Do we know the size?
   2. Will the size ever be zero?
   3. Will data be duplicated?

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
   - Base case: Define what to do when the function does not call itself.
