## General Info

- Git is a DVCS Distributed Version Control Systems. A DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
- **Snapshots** - Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project (git commit)  Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
- **Local Operations** - Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.
- **Tracking Changes** - Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.
- **Loss of Data** - Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
- **States** - Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
  - **Committed** - Data is securely stored in a local database.
  - **Modified** - File has been changed but not committed to the database.
  - **Staged** - Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.
