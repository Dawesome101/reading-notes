## Code 102 Reading Notes
<sub>Having tested out of Code 102, no notes were taken during the course however while doing the prework for 201, notes were gathered from the suggested reading and tutorials which are visble here in the following entries.</sub>

- #### General Info
  - Git is a DVCS Distributed Version Control Systems. A DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
    - **Snapshots** - Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project \(git commit\)  Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
    - **Local Operations** - Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.
    - **Tracking Changes** - Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.
    - **Loss of Data** - Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
    - **States** - Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
      - **Committed** - Data is securely stored in a local database.
      - **Modified** - File has been changed but not committed to the database.
      - **Staged** - Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.

- #### Basic Commands
  - **sudo apt-get install git** - Install git for ubuntu.
  - **git config --list** - Check git settings.
  - **git help command || git command --help || man git-command** - 3 ways to access git help.
